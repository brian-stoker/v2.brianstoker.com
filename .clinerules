# Project-Specific Rules for brianstoker.com

## Testing and Validation

- **Always use MCP devtools (browser automation) to test UI changes** when possible
- The dev server runs on port 5040 (http://localhost:5040)
- For mobile/responsive testing, resize the browser viewport using `mcp__server-name__resize_page`
- Use `evaluate_script` to inspect DOM state, scroll positions, and computed styles
- Take screenshots to visually confirm changes
- Test interactive features (scroll, click, navigation) directly in the browser

## Development Notes

- Next.js API routes can be slow to compile in dev mode - allow extra time for first requests
- The project uses Material-UI (MUI) with custom theming
- Mobile breakpoint is 900px (use `useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down(900))`)
