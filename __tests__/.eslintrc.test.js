It looks like you have a large configuration file for ESLint, a JavaScript linter. I'll provide some suggestions on how to improve the formatting and structure of the code.

Here are some specific changes that can be made:

1. **Consistent indentation**: The indentation is inconsistent throughout the file. It's recommended to use 2 or 4 spaces for consistent indentation.
2. **Newlines between rules**: Some rules have multiple lines, which can make the configuration hard to read. Consider using newlines between each rule to separate them more clearly.
3. **Consistent naming conventions**: The naming conventions for properties and functions are not consistent throughout the file. Use a single convention consistently throughout the file.
4. **Remove unnecessary whitespace**: Some rules have unnecessary whitespace, such as multiple spaces or tabs. Remove these to make the configuration cleaner.

Here's an example of how the configuration could be refactored:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    // ...
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-trailing-spaces": "error",
    "no-missing-imports": "error",
    // ...
  },
  "plugins": [],
  "globals": {
    // ...
  }
}
```
And here's an example of how the `no-restricted-imports` rule could be configured:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        "paths": [
          {
            "name": "@stoked-ui/[^/]",
            "message": "forbidTopLevelMessage"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Note that I've removed some of the unnecessary whitespace and reformatted the code to be more readable.

Also, it's worth noting that this configuration file is quite large and complex. It might be a good idea to break it down into smaller files or modules, each with its own specific rules and configurations.
