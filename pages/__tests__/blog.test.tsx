The code provided appears to be a React-based application, specifically a blog or news site, with a focus on using CSS variables (also known as theme colors) for styling. 

After reviewing the code, I have identified several potential issues and suggestions:

1. **Unused imports**: The `Link` component is imported from a library called `@mui/material`, but it's not used anywhere in the code. You can remove this import to declutter the code.

2. **Magic numbers**: There are many magic numbers scattered throughout the code, such as `90`, `9`, `2.5`, etc. These should be replaced with named constants or variables for better readability and maintainability.

3. **Typography sizes**: The `fontSize` props are used to set font sizes, but it's not clear what these values represent in terms of visual hierarchy or readability. Consider using a more robust typography system that uses named sizes (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) instead of numeric values.

4. ** CSS variables**: While the use of CSS variables is generally good practice, some variables (e.g., `$divider`) are not properly scoped and may cause issues when reused elsewhere in the application. Make sure to scope these variables correctly using the `var` keyword or by adding a class that targets only the desired element.

5. **Component naming**: Some component names (e.g., `PostPreview`, `HeroEnd`, `AppFooter`) are not descriptive enough and may make it harder for others to understand their purpose. Consider renaming these components to something more meaningful.

6. **Function naming**: Function names like `setQueryParams` and `removeTag` could be renamed to better reflect their functionality. For example, `updateQueryString` and `deleteTag`.

7. **Performance optimization**: The code uses many nested JSX elements, which can lead to performance issues if the application grows in complexity. Consider using a more efficient rendering strategy, such as memoization or React.lazy.

8. **Type definitions**: The code does not include any type definitions for its components or functions. Adding type definitions can help catch errors and improve maintainability.

Here's an updated version of the code with some of these suggestions applied:

```jsx
import { Box } from '@mui/system';
import { Link, GitHubIcon, SlackIcon, DiscordIcon, LinkedInIcon } from '@mui/icons-material';
import { Pagination } from '@mui/material';

// ...

<Box component="ul" sx={{ p: 0, m: 0 }}>
  {displayedPosts.map((post) => (
    <Box
      key={post.slug}
      sx={() => ({
        py: '2.5rem',
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'column',
        position: 'relative',
        '&:not(:last-of-type)': {
          borderBottom: '1px solid',
          borderColor: '$divider',
        },
      })}
    >
      <PostPreview {...post} />
    </Box>
  ))}
</Box>

<Pagination
  page={page + 1}
  count={totalPage}
  variant="outlined"
  shape="rounded"
  onChange={(_, value) => {
    setPage(value - 1);
    postListRef.current?.scrollIntoView();
  }}
  sx={{ mt: '2rem', mb: '8rem' }}
/>
```

```jsx
const updateQueryString = (params, tag) => {
  const newUrlParams = { ...params };
  newUrlParams.tags = newUrlParams.tags || [];
  if (newUrlParams.tags.includes(tag)) {
    newUrlParams.tags = newUrlParams.tags.filter((tagValue) => tagValue !== tag);
  } else {
    newUrlParams.tags.push(tag);
  }
  return new URLSearchParams(newUrlParams).toString();
};

const deleteTag = (tag) => {
  const updatedQueryString = updateQueryString({}, tag);
  setQueryParams(updatedQueryString);
};
```
