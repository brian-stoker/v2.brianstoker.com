The code you provided appears to be a ReactJS application written in JavaScript. The structure of the code is well-organized and follows standard React conventions.

However, there are a few potential improvements that could be made:

1. **Organization**: The code can be further organized into smaller, more manageable components. For example, the `Frequently asked questions` section could be broken down into separate components for each question.
2. **CSS**: Some of the CSS styles are applied directly to the JSX elements. While this is a common pattern in React, it's often better to create a separate stylesheet or CSS module to keep your code organized and reusable.
3. **Performance**: The code uses `React.Fragment` extensively, which can be replaced with regular HTML elements for improved performance. This is not necessarily an issue in this code snippet, but it's worth considering when optimizing future changes.
4. **Type Safety**: There are no type annotations in the code, which could lead to type-related issues down the line. Adding type annotations using TypeScript or other static type checkers can help catch errors and improve code maintainability.

Here is an example of how you might refactor the code to address some of these points:
```jsx
// FrequentlyAskedQuestions.js
import React from 'react';

const FrequentlyAskedQuestions = () => {
  const questions = [
    { title: 'What is your company culture?', description: '...' },
    // ...
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <ul>
        {questions.map((question, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            <h3>{question.title}</h3>
            <p>{question.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FrequentlyAskedQuestions;
```
Similarly, you could create a separate component for each question, like so:
```jsx
// Question.js
import React from 'react';

const Question = ({ title, description }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Question;
```
You could then import and use these components in your main application file:
```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import FrequentlyAskedQuestions from './FrequentlyAskedQuestions';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Company Overview</h1>
      {/* ... */}
      <FrequentlyAskedQuestions />
    </div>
  );
};
```
This refactoring approach can help keep your code organized, reusable, and maintainable over time.
