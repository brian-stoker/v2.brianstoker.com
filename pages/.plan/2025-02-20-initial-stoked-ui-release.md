## Into the Wild

Even though itâ€™s still early days for Stoked UI, Iâ€™ve decided to cut actual versions of each of the core modules. While there are still plenty of bugs to fix and improvements to make, these modules are now functional and valuable enough to be out in the world.

### Released Versions

- **@stoked-ui/common** â€“ `0.1.0`
- **@stoked-ui/file-explorer** â€“ `0.1.0`
- **@stoked-ui/media-selector** â€“ `0.1.1`
- **@stoked-ui/timeline** â€“ `0.1.1`
- **@stoked-ui/editor** â€“ `0.1.0`

These modules can now be installed via **pnpm** (correct choice ðŸ˜‰), **yarn**, or **npm**.

### Website & Future Plans

The home page for Stoked UI is now live at [stoked-ui.com](https://stoked-ui.com), and there are plans to provide an **MUI-style set of examples and documentation** when I (or someone else) gets around to it. Until then, expect things to be a bit rough, but the goal is to make Stoked UI an intuitive and extensible toolset for client-side video editing in React.

Feedback, contributions, and bug reports are all welcome! ðŸš€
