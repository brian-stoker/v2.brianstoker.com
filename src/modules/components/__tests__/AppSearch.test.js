This is a React component written in JavaScript, specifically using Material-UI library. It appears to be a custom implementation of a search bar and related components.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

**SearchBar component**

The `SearchBar` component is likely a container for various search-related elements, such as input fields, buttons, and dropdowns. The styles for this component are defined in an object, which is then passed to the `style` prop of the component.

**GlobalStyles component**

The `GlobalStyles` component is used to apply global styles to the application. It takes a function that returns an array of styles, which are then applied to the entire document.

In this case, the GlobalStyles component is used to define custom styles for different modes (e.g., "dark" mode). These styles are likely used to enhance the user experience in a dark environment.

**Key styles**

Some notable styles defined in this code include:

* `--docsearch-primary-color` and `--docsearch-hit-active-color`: These variables are used to define colors for the search bar's primary color and hit active color, respectively.
* `.DocSearch-Container`: This class is used to set a background color on the container element when it's in "dark" mode.
* `.DocSearch-NewStartScreenTitleIcon`, `.DocSearch-NewStartScreenItem`, `.DocSearch-Modal`, etc.: These classes are used to define styles for various elements, such as icons, buttons, and dropdowns, depending on the mode.

**Usage**

To use this code in a React application, you would:

1. Create a new React component that imports the `SearchBar` component.
2. Wrap your application with the `React.StrictMode` component to enable strict mode for better error detection.
3. Pass the `GlobalStyles` component as a child of the `React.StrictMode` component, along with the styles function defined in this code.
4. Use the `SearchBar` component in your application, either directly or through a higher-order component (HOC) to wrap it.

Here's an example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { SearchBar } from './SearchBar';
import GlobalStyles from './GlobalStyles';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <GlobalStyles styles={styles} />
    <SearchBar />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
Note that this is just a rough outline, and you'll need to adapt the code to fit your specific use case.
