This is a React component written in JavaScript, specifically using the Material-UI library. It appears to be part of a documentation site or an app layout for displaying a footer with links and social media buttons.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Component Structure**

The component consists of several sections:

1. A top-level container element (`<AppLayoutDocsFooter />`) that wraps all other elements.
2. A `<Stack>` component from Material-UI, which is used to layout various elements horizontally or vertically.
3. Several child components, including:
	* A form with a submit button and a reset button.
	* A dialog component for displaying a confirmation message.
	* An alert component for displaying a warning message.
	* A link to the Stoked UI homepage.
	* Social media buttons (Discord, LinkedIn) with links to their respective websites.

**Form**

The form is defined using the `form` element and contains several child elements:

1. An input field (`<InputField />`) that accepts a comment or feedback from users.
2. A link to submit the feedback via GitHub (using the `process.env.GITHUB_TEMPLATE_DOCS_FEEDBACK` variable).
3. A reset button with the label "Cancel".
4. A submit button with the label "Submit".

**Dialog Component**

The dialog component is used to display a confirmation message when the user clicks the "Submit" button.

**Alert Component**

The alert component is used to display a warning message when the user is trying to submit feedback on a specific use case that requires GitHub issues (i.e., `rating !== 1`).

**Social Media Buttons**

The social media buttons are wrapped in an `<IconButton>` component and contain links to the respective websites.

**Props**

The component expects two props:

1. `location`: a string prop representing the current location.
2. `tableOfContents`: an array of props that is not used anywhere in the code snippet.

Overall, this component seems to be designed for displaying a footer with various elements, including a form for submitting feedback, social media buttons, and links to external websites.
