The provided code snippet is written in JavaScript and uses various libraries such as React, Material-UI, and JSX. It appears to be a part of a larger application that showcases various components from the Material-UI library.

To improve this code, here are some suggestions:

1. **Consistent naming conventions**: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. To maintain consistency, it's better to stick with one convention throughout the codebase.

2. **Type annotations**: Adding type annotations can make the code more readable and help catch type-related errors earlier. For example, you could add `type Demo = 'Tabs' | 'Button' | 'Menu';` for the `demo` variable.

3. **Extract functions**: The component is quite long and performs multiple tasks. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the component's behavior.

4. **Reduce repetition**: There are repeated JSX elements in the code. You can extract these into separate components to avoid duplication and make maintenance easier.

5. **Use destructuring**: Instead of using `theme.applyDarkStyles`, you could use destructuring to access the required properties, making the code more readable.

6. **Consider using a CSS-in-JS solution**: Material-UI is built on top of CSS, but some developers prefer using CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled Components or Emotion. These libraries can help keep your styles separate from your component logic and make your code easier to manage.

Here's an example of how you could refactor the `BaseTabsDemo` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BaseTabs } from '@mui/material';

interface DemoProps {
  styling: string;
}

const TabsDemo: React.FC<DemoProps> = ({ styling }) => {
  if (styling === 'system') {
    return <BaseTabs />;
  }
  // Add logic for other styles
};
```

```jsx
import { BaseTabs } from '@mui/material';

interface DemoProps {
  styling: string;
}

const TabsDemo: React.FC<DemoProps> = ({ styling }) => {
  switch (styling) {
    case 'system':
      return <BaseTabs />;
    // Add logic for other styles
    default:
      return null;
  }
};
```

Note that these are just examples, and you should adapt the refactoring process to your specific use case.
