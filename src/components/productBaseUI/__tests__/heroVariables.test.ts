It appears that you have a JavaScript file with three different theme configurations: `sleek`, `retro`, and `playful`. Each configuration is an object with various CSS properties.

To make this code more readable and maintainable, I recommend the following:

1. Extract each theme into its own separate file.
2. Use a consistent naming convention for your theme files (e.g., `sleek.js`, `retro.js`, `playful.js`).
3. Consider using a CSS-in-JS solution like styled components or emotion to define your styles.

Here's an example of how you can refactor the code:

**Theme configurations**

Create separate files for each theme:
```javascript
// sleek.js
export default {
  // theme properties
};
```

```javascript
// retro.js
export default {
  // theme properties
};
```

```javascript
// playful.js
export default {
  // theme properties
};
```

**Main file**

In your main file, import each theme configuration and export them as an array:
```javascript
import sleek from './sleek';
import retro from './retro';
import playful from './playful';

export default [sleek, retro, playful];
```
This way, you can easily switch between different themes by importing the desired configuration.

**CSS-in-JS solution**

If you want to use a CSS-in-JS solution, you can define your styles as objects and import them into each theme file:
```javascript
// sleek.js
import { styled } from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 24px;
`;

export default {
  // theme properties
  Button,
};
```

This way, you can use the `Button` component in your components without having to worry about CSS styles.

Note that this is just a suggestion, and you can adjust the code according to your specific needs.
