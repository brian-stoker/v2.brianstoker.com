The code snippet you've provided seems to be a collection of CSS theme definitions for a Material UI application. Each theme object defines the colors, typography, and other visual elements that are used throughout the app.

Here's a review of your code:

1. **Organization**: Your themes are stored in an array at the end of the file. This is a good approach as it makes it easy to import multiple themes from a single file.
2. **Theme structure**: Each theme object has a similar structure, which includes:
	* `tokens`: These define the base colors and typography used throughout the app.
	* `components`: These define the visual elements for specific components, such as buttons or tabs.
3. **Consistency**: You've tried to be consistent in your naming conventions (e.g., using camelCase for property names) and color palette usage.
4. **Duplicated code**: There are some duplicated values between themes (e.g., `--color-primary`), which can make maintenance harder.

To improve the code, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Simplify theme definitions**: Reduce the duplication by creating a separate file for common tokens or components that can be reused across themes.
2. **Use a consistent naming convention**: While your use of camelCase is mostly correct, some property names (e.g., `--border-radius`) don't follow this convention.
3. **Consider using a theme framework**: Libraries like Tailwind CSS or Emotion provide pre-built theme definitions that you can adapt to your app's needs.

Here's an example of how the themes could be refactored:

**tokens.js**
```javascript
export const colors = {
  primary: '#3498db',
  secondary: '#f1c40f',
  // ...
};

export const typography = {
  fontSize: '16px',
  fontFamily: 'Poppins, sans-serif',
  // ...
};
```

**components.js**
```javascript
export const buttonStyles = {
  backgroundColor: colors.primary,
  color: colors.secondary,
  // ...
};

export const tabStyles = {
  backgroundColor: colors.secondary,
  color: colors.primary,
  // ...
};
```

Then, in your theme definitions:

```javascript
const sleek = {
  tokens: { ...colors },
  components: { Button: buttonStyles, Tab: tabStyles },
};

const retro = {
  tokens: { ...colors },
  components: { Button: buttonStyles, Tab: tabStyles },
};

const playful = {
  tokens: { ...colors },
  components: { Button: buttonStyles, Tab: tabStyles },
};
```

This refactored version reduces duplicated code and makes it easier to maintain your theme definitions.
