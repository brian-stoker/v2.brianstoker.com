The provided code snippet is for a React application, and it appears to be using Material UI components. The `DataTable` function returns a `ShowcaseContainer` component with a `Paper` component inside it. The `Paper` component contains an `XGridGlobalStyles` component, a `Typography` component with the title "Trades, October 2020", a `Divider`, and a `Box` component that wraps a `DataGrid`.

The `DataGrid` component is used to display data in a table format. It takes three main props: `rows`, `columns`, and `density`. The `rows` prop is an array of objects that represent the data to be displayed, similar to what you provided earlier.

To add more columns to the `DataGrid`, you can simply pass additional objects to the `columns` prop. Here's an updated version of the code with two additional columns:

```jsx
export default function DataTable() {
  const rows = [
    // ... (rest of the rows remain the same)
  ];

  const columns = [
    { field: 'date', headerName: 'Date', width: 150 },
    { field: 'type', headerName: 'Type', width: 100 },
    { field: 'amount', headerName: 'Amount', width: 100 },
  ];

  return (
    <ShowcaseContainer
      preview={
        // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
      }
      code={
        // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
      }
    />
  );
}
```

In this updated version, we've added two new columns to the `columns` array: `date` and `type`. These columns have a fixed width of 150 pixels and 100 pixels, respectively.

Note that you may need to adjust the widths to fit your specific requirements. Also, if you want to make the columns more dynamic or conditional, you can use Material UI's built-in support for dynamic columns by using the `rowId` prop when defining the column headers.
