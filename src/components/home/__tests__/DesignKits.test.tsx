This is a React Native code snippet. Here are the key points about the code:

**Purpose**: The code is for a design component that showcases various design kits (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD) with animations.

**Key Components**:

1. `DesignKitTools`: A box containing three design tool logos: Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD.
2. `DesignKits`: The main container component that holds the `DesignKitTools` and two sets of images (`DesignKitImagesSet1` and `DesignKitImagesSet2`) with animations.

**Key Features**:

1. **Animations**: The design kit tools are animated to enter the screen, which gives a nice visual effect.
2. **Gradient Backgrounds**: Each section has a gradient background that transitions from one color to another, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.
3. **Perspective Transform**: The `perspective` property is used on the wrapper box to create a sense of depth, especially in Safari.

**Notes**:

1. This code uses React Native components (e.g., `Box`, `FadeDelay`) which suggests it's intended for use on mobile devices or desktop platforms.
2. The code uses theme colors and styles from a design system (likely Material-UI or a custom one) to ensure consistency across the component.
3. There are some Safari-specific features used in this code, such as the `perspective` property, which may not work on other browsers.

Overall, this code is well-structured, readable, and uses some nice animations and design elements to showcase the various design kits.
